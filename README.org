* Elescope

** Overview
Most of programming really is looking at other people's code. Until
Emacs can remotely open and browse remote repositories, Elescope will
prompt a forge then auto-complete the repo name and clone it into a
directory of your choice (~elescope-root-folder~).

** Usage
- ~package-install~ ~RET~ ~elescope~ ~RET~
- ~customize-variable~ ~elescope-root-folder~
- ~elescope-clone~.
