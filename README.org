* Elescope

[[https://github.com/freesteph/elescope/raw/master/elescope-logo.png]]

** Overview

[[https://github.com/freesteph/elescope/raw/master/elescope-demo.gif]]

Most of programming lies in other people's code, and in
Emacs. Elescope brings you the best of both by allowing you to quickly
search and clone any project found on the main forges (*only GitHub at
the moment*, until the author manages to implement other ones).

This package uses [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][ivy]] and [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request][request]].

** Usage
1. Put this package somewhere familiar and load it;
2. ~customize-variable~ ~elescope-root-folder~ to tell Elescope
   where to clone;
3. ~elescope-checkout~.

** Configuration

*** ~elescope-root-folder~

Where to clone repos. No default set.

*** ~elescope-clone-depth~

How deep should the repos be cloned. Defaults to 1 so all clones are
shallow.
